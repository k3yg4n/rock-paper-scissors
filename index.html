    <h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
    <p class="gameDesc">
        In rock-paper-scissors, two players will each randomly choose one of three hand signs: rock, paper, or scissors. Both players show their signs at the same time to see who will win. Here are the rules that determine which sign beats another: Rock wins over scissors (because rock smashes scissors). Scissors wins over paper (because scissors cut paper) Paper wins over rock (because paper covers rock). Play against a computer by clicking one of the three buttons below.
